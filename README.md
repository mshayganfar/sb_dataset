# General Overview:

In BOLD5000, researchers have increased the stimulus set size deployed in an fMRI study of visual scene processing.

Researchers scanned 4 participants in a slow-evented related design with 4,916 unique scenes.
Data was collected over 16 sessions, 15 of which were task-related sessions, plus an additional session for acquiring high resolution anatomical scans.
In 8 of the 15 task-related sessions, a functional localizer was run in order to independently define scene-selective cortex.
In each scanning session, participants filled out a questionnaire (Daily Intake) about their daily routine, including: current status regarding food and beverage intake, sleep, exercise, ibuprofen, and comfort in the scanner. 
During BOLD scanning, physiological data (heart rate and respiration) were also acquired.

# Stimuli and Presentation Details:
The experiment includes:

1) 4,803 images presented on a single trial throughout the experiment
2) 112 images repeated four times, and one image repeated three times
3) a total of 5,254 stimuli trials.

The stimuli were drawn from three datasets:

1) 1000 images from Scene Images (with scene categories based on SUN categories)
2) 2000 images from the COCO dataset
3) 1916 images from the ImageNet dataset

Images were presented for 1 second, with 9 seconds of fixation between trials. Participants were asked to judge whether they liked, disliked, or were neutral about the image.

# Summary:

In sum, this dataset is unique in three ways: it is

1) significantly larger than existing slow-event related neural datasets by an order of magnitude
2) extremely diverse in stimuli
3) considerably overlapping with existing computer vision datasets

This large-scale dataset enables novel neural network training and novel exploration of benchmark computer vision datasets through neuroscience. Finally, the scale advantage of this dataset and the use of a slow event-related design enables, for the first time, joint computer vision and fMRI analyses that span a significant and diverse region of image space using high-performing models.
